This is my first ever Kaggle Notebook. I'm not yet familiar with Kaggle so please bear with me.\n","\n","\n","# Background\n","\n","In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.\n","\n","Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n","\n","\n","# Case study (ASK)\n","\n","This report will examine the business question: 'what is the most effective marketing strategy to converting  Cyclistic’s casual riders to annul memberships?'\n","\n","It is understood that the goal can be broken down into 3 main questions.\n","\n"," 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? \n"," 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? \n"," 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n","\n","\n","This report will seek to deliver on the following objectives:\n","\n","**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n","\n","\n","# Stakeholders\n","\n","This report also seeks to identify the important stakeholders that are involved in the overall analysis.
